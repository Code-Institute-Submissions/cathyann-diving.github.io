                <h3>Redang Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Redang Island is famous for its crystal clear waters, white sandy beaches, and the tropical fish that inhabit the numerous reefs, many within 50 feet of the shore. Redang has a more upmarket image, as almost all accommodation on the island is resort-based.
                    The largest beach is Pasir Panjang on the east side, featuring half a dozen resorts. However, on the south end this beach usually has more choppy water and the beaches will have more debris than the beaches around the bend to the north.
                    The snorkeling is also found to the north of Pasir Panjang. Redang has a tropical climate with temperatures steadily around 30°C and frequent but brief thunderstoms. Like the rest of Malaysia's East Coast, Redang is affected by the
                    northeast monsoon in winter, so most resorts are closed and ferry transport schedules are severely restricted between November and February.

                <h3>Tioman Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulau Tioman is a duty-free island off Peninsular Malaysia's east coast, acclaimed as a geological wonder, ecological paradise and one of Southeast Asia's most beautiful travel destinations. Located 32 nautical miles off the mainland, but connected through
                    Mersing (Johor) and Tanjung Gemuk (Pahang) via ferry, the island continues to enchant visitors with its warm beaches, lovely seas and lush greenery. Gazetted as a marine park, the immediate waters are abundant with coral reefs and
                    marine life - ideal for scuba diving and snorkelling. Much of the island is covered by pristine rainforest, home to several endemic wildlife species and suitable for nature explorations. Finally, Tioman Island attracts youthful travellers
                    from around the world - truly a melting pot of cultures to meet on vacation.

                <h3>Sipadan Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Sipadan is the only oceanic island in Malaysia, rising 600 metres (2,000 ft) from the seabed. It is located in the Celebes Sea off the east coast of Sabah, Malaysia. It was formed by living corals growing on top of an extinct volcanic cone that took thousands
                    of years to develop. Sipadan is located at the heart of the Indo-Pacific basin, the centre of one of the richest marine habitats in the world. More than 400 species of fish and hundreds of coral species have been classified in this
                    ecosystem. Sipadan Island was at the top of Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine Gold List for 'The Top Dive Destination in the World'. In fact it shared its top spot with 2 other destinations known for the diversity of their marine life
                    — the Galápagos Islands and Truk in Micronesia. Frequently seen in the waters around Sipadan: green and hawksbill turtles (which mate and nest there), enormous schools of barracuda in tornado-like formations as well as large schools
                    of big-eye trevally, and bumphead parrotfish. Pelagic species such as manta rays, eagle rays, scalloped hammerhead sharks and whale sharks also visit Sipadan. A turtle tomb lies underneath the column of the island, formed by an underwater
                    limestone cave with a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers that contain many skeletal remains of turtles that become lost and drown before finding the surface. Visiting Sipadan Island requires a permit issued by Sabah Parks, a Sabah Government
                    agency.

                <h3>Tenggol Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Tenggol Island is part of a group of islands within the southern regions of the Terengganu Marine Park. Besides Tenggol the group consists of Pulau Nyireh, Tokong Timur, Tokong Burung and Tokong Talang/Tokong Kemudi and Tokong Laut. There are numerous
                    beautiful beaches, and also a few paths that cross the 3 by 2km island; great for some light trekking. Most people visit the Tenggol for its amazing diving possibilities; there are 20 dive sites around the island. Non-divers could
                    enjoy some snorkeling around the island (though Perhentian Island probably is a better choice).
