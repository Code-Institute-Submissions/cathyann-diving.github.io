                <h3>Redang Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulau Redang is a small island group in the South Chinese Sea, on the east side of Peninsular Malaysia. Redang lies within protected marine waters, also known as Terengganu Marine Park. It lies about 45 kilometers from the coast of the city of Kuala Terengganu.
                    Next to the main island Redang are many other smaller surrounding islands. The island is surrounded by crystal clear water and has various beautiful diving possibilities for the aficionados. You can also snorkel around the island;
                    the coral reefs are in good health. Redang usually is not too crowded, though during local school holidays and public holidays it can get very busy on the island.

                <h3>Tioman Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulau Tioman is a duty-free island off Peninsular Malaysia's east coast, acclaimed as a geological wonder, ecological paradise and one of Southeast Asia's most beautiful travel destinations. Located 32 nautical miles off the mainland, but connected through
                    Mersing (Johor) and Tanjung Gemuk (Pahang) via ferry, the island continues to enchant visitors with its warm beaches, lovely seas and lush greenery. Gazetted as a marine park, the immediate waters are abundant with coral reefs and
                    marine life - ideal for scuba diving and snorkelling. Much of the island is covered by pristine rainforest, home to several endemic wildlife species and suitable for nature explorations. Finally, Tioman Island attracts youthful travellers
                    from around the world - truly a melting pot of cultures to meet on vacation.

                <h3>Sipadan Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Sipadan is one of the most beautiful scuba diving spots in the world. Sipadan is the only oceanic island in Malaysia, the huge pillar that forms the atoll functions as a shelter for many sea animals and fish. Furthermore there are only a few places in
                    the world that have such a concentration of sea turtles. Sipadan is not easy to visit; you can only stay at the surrounding islands Mabul and Kapalai. The permits these days make it even harder to dive at Sipadan; because only a handful
                    of people per day may dive at the small island (regulations permit 120 dives per day). So it is important to get your Sipadan diving permit in advance. To get your permit, you have to book a diving or non-diving package to Sipadan
                    Island (the longer your stay, the bigger your chance of obtaining a permit). Do know that accommodation at Mabul or Kapalai is not that cheap. Budget travelers that find Mabul or Kapalai too expensive (or when the facilities are fully
                    booked) could opt to stay at the village of Semporna. This fishing village mainly serves as a gateway to Sipadan and other great scuba diving spots as Mabul, Kapalai and Mataking. The several fish restaurants in Semporna offer great
                    food, though the village itself is often described as a bit dull.

                <h3>Tenggol Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Tenggol Island is part of a group of islands within the southern regions of the Terengganu Marine Park. Besides Tenggol the group consists of Pulau Nyireh, Tokong Timur, Tokong Burung and Tokong Talang/Tokong Kemudi and Tokong Laut. There are numerous
                    beautiful beaches, and also a few paths that cross the 3 by 2km island; great for some light trekking. Most people visit the Tenggol for its amazing diving possibilities; there are 20 dive sites around the island. Non-divers could
                    enjoy some snorkeling around the island (though Perhentian Island probably is a better choice).
